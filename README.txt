BRITTANY KRAEMER
TEAM: BLK

INTRO:
	The purpose of this project is to create a display of three sorting algorithms
	(Mergesort, Quicksort, and Bubblesort) on an HTML page. The display will show 
	each algorithm's step function and run at the same time to easily determine which
	algorithm finished first, second, and third. 

CONTENTS:
	sorting.html
	README.txt
	assets {
		js_functions.js
		style.css
	}

EXTERNAL REQUIREMENTS:
	None

SETUP AND INSTALLATION:
	Sublime Text - for editing .html and .js files

FEATURES:
	- Color changes on each new line of algorithm
	- Each algorithm is displayed side-by-side
	- The algorithms will run until list is completely sorted
	- Algorithms are defined as asynchronous functions

BUGS:
	None
